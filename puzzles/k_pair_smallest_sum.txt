LeetCode â€“ Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums (Java)
 
 You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.

 Define a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

 Find the k pairs (u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.


 Example:

 Given nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6],  k = 3

 Return: [1,2],[1,4],[1,6]

 The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence:
 [1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]
